=== 1.2.1 / 2008-01-11

* More documentation (Mikel)

=== 1.2.0 / 2007-11-29

* 5 major enhancements:
  * Extensive documentation work. (mikel)
  * Renamed scanner_c.c to mailscanner.c. (trans)
  * Removed base64 c extension. It's speed benefit was negligable (only 0.2 sec over 10000 sizable encode/decode runs) (trans)
  * Closed 15445 - TMail::Mail#create_forward now returns a new Mail object that has the original mail as an encoded 7 bit multipart attachment.  Also moved create_forward and create_reply from tmail/net into tmail/interface as it makes more sense to have it there. (mikel)
  * Closed 15643 - TMail::Mail#reply_addresses was returning an empty array if reply_to was set to nil (ie, the header field existed but was empty) instead of returning the from address or default. (mikel)
  * Closed 16025 - TMail scanner.rb would not parse ATOM chars correctly making it fail tests where the C version passed them.  Fixed this by updating the Scanner.rb version to be in step with the C version (there was an extra @ symbol in the ATOM CHARS definition that was not in the C version.) (mikel)
  * Fixed scanner.rb so that it would pass the same tests that the C version does - had a sundry @ symbol inside of the ATOM CHARS
* 3 minor enhancements:
  * Renamed scanner_c.c to tmailscanner.c (trans)
  * Changed TMail::Mail#sender to have a default "default" value of nil to be in alignment with all the other interface methods (mikel)
  * Made base64_decode and base64_encode into ! versions as they are destructive on the mail body (encodes the body to base64 or decodes it), made aliases for base64_decode and base64_encode to point back to the bang versions.  Doing this with a view to change base64_encode to a non destructive version (returns the encoded body) in future versions. (mikel)

=== 1.1.1 / 2007-11-05

* 3 major enhancement:
  * Created unified package, for installation in any platform.
  * Added require_arch.rb to facilitate multi-platform support.
  * If compilation fails, set NORUBYEXT="true" and reinstall.
* 3 minor enhancement:
  * Fixed line wrapping of long header fields so that they wrap at the correct whitespace points.
  * Fixed bug where re-assigning the mail.body to existing mail object that already had a parsed body would not re-parse the body.
  * Started documenting the source code... lots more to do.

=== 1.1.0 / 2007-10-28

* 1 minor enhancements:
  * Changed the quoting of paramaters in the header fields to wrap double quotes around fields that are needed to be quoted.
  * Removed keeping double quotes around a filename that does not need double quotes per RFC 1521
  * More clean up and getting tests passing.  Now standing at 2 failures out of 3366 assertions.  One is the incorrect handling of "@"@test.com (returns @@test.com) and the other is a japanese encoding issue.

=== 1.0.0 / 2007-10-28

* 1 major enhancement:
  * TMail is now released as a GEM!
