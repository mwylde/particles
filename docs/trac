Trac
====

Install the following plugin on your Trac server before proceeding: http://github.com/davglass/github-trac/

  1. url field is your Trac install's url
  2. token (this needs to be the same token you put in your trac.ini installed via the plugin)


The plugin searches commit messages for text in the form of:
    command #1
    command #1, #2
    command #1 & #2 
    command #1 and #2

Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:
    command ticket:1
    command ticket:1, ticket:2
    command ticket:1 & ticket:2 
    command ticket:1 and ticket:2
