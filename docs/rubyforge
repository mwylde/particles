RubyForge
=========

Special Thanks
-------------

Would like to notice Ara Howard and his RubyForge gem, from which I copied most of the code
used in this service.  Would also like to notice the author of the Basecamp service, since
I used that service as a template for the RubyForge service.

This service simply posts a new NewsByte to the RubyForge project (as specified by the groupid).

Install Notes
-------------

  1. username should be the username of a user that has access to the RubyForge project
  2. password should be the password of the given user
  3. groupid should be the group id of the RubyForge project
