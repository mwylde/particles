Lighthouse
========

Install Notes
-------------

Using the following url as an example:
http://logicalawesome.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8570-github/overview

  1. subdomain is logicalawesome
  2. project_id is 8570
  3. this service only supports project tokens
     (accepting patches for user-based tokens)
  4. 'private' determines whether changed files 
     should be displayed (useful for public LH 
     accounts and private GH repos)
